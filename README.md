# spell-checker-dsa-project
Spell checker project for Data Structures and Algorithms
 
Project format:
-Each data structure will be implemented on a new code file
-Each file will have the following:
  - function to load words from dictionary into the data structure
  - function to search/traverse data structure when search key is given
  - function to make suggestions
-Search algorithms have to be the same to compare time difference accurately

Current tasks (in order of priority):
1. Read about data structure implementation in code: Read basic creation of structure and traversal.
  - Shashwat: Trie, Ternary Search Tree
  - Hriday: Trie, BK tree
  - Insaf: Trie, Radix tree
  
2. Read about implementation of suggestion algorithms:
  - Hriday: Levenshtein distance
  - Insaf: Damereau-Levenshtein distance
  - Shashwat: Wagner and Fischer, string-to-string correction problem 
  
  Other algorithms:
  ● Boyer-Moore, fast string matching, 1977
  ● Knuth, fast pattern matching, 1977
  ● Sellers, evolutionary distances, 1980
  ● Ukkonnen, approximate string matching, 1985
  ● Zobel and Dart, approximate string matches in a large lexicon, 1995
  
Deadlines:
29/3/17: Task 1, meet up and discuss
9/4/16: Completion of Task 1
*12/4/16: REVIEW 2*
